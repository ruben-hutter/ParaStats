# ParaStats

A small project that will show some stats about a flight recorded by a vario.

The idea is to extend the project to have a GUI and to show also graphically the datas, and also to show the gps track in 3D on a map.

## How to run programm

It is possible to run the programm either with a specific file, or to let it calculate a mean of all flight saved in the Data folder. If this folder does not exist, the programm will give an error.

**Run programm with a specific file**:

`python3 launcher.py <file_path>`

**Run programm on folder containing multiple flights**:

`python3 launcher.py <directory_path>`
